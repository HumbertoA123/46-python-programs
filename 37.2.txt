1 The Greeks or Hellenes (Greek: Έλληνες [ˈelines]) are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, southern Albania, Turkey, Sicily, Egypt

2 and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek

3 communities established around the world.

5 Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek

6 people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age.[43][44]

7 Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea

8 coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople.[44] Many of these regions coincided to a large

9 extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek

10 colonization.[45] The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at

11 various periods.

13 Most ethnic Greeks live nowadays within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus. The Greek genocide and population exchange

14 between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. Other longstanding Greek populations can

15 be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other

16 countries. Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church.[46]
